COVID-19 Unemployment Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates across various countries. By leveraging publicly available datasets, we explore trends, patterns, and correlations between lockdown measures and unemployment spikes during the pandemic.

Objectives
Investigate the unemployment rate changes before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Utilize statistical and data visualization techniques to illustrate the relationship between COVID-19 case numbers, government policies, and unemployment rates.
Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis to understand the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.

Technologies Used:
Python: For data analysis and modeling.
Pandas: To handle data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: To document the analysis process and findings.
